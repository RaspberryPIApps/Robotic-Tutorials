### Intro
ipython has become very popular among Python community; most new books provide their code in that format. 
Essentially, it is a great way to combine documentation in github's md (markdown) format and code. 
You insert cells, declare them as markdown or code (other choices are headline levels - they probably
translate to HTML code - try!) and add the appropriate text. 
For md, go here for a good tutorial: https://help.github.com/articles/markdown-basics/
The code base for 'iPython interactive cookbook' is located here: https://github.com/ipython-books/cookbook-code
Their very first example is a simple example that provides you with the key capabilities of iPython. 
You can copy this example and edit it and learn quickly how to document your own ipynb file. 
iPython gives you access to command shell commands (for directory, path, install, etc) and other 'magic' commands 
which provide tools for introspection (more on the data, variables, and functions) and help. You can also embed plots
inline in the documentation. Use the right pointing filled arrow at the top to exeute the md or python code to see the
result. You can include a copy of the results and discuss as you would in a manual. 

### Anaconda
For that, you will need a ipython notebook enviroment. I downloaded anaconda from here: http://ipython.org/install.html
Anaconda comes packaged with 195 packages. This list includes numpy, pandas, PIL, and matplotlib. You do not have 
to install these using pip install; but the Python universe has many other packages which you will have to install - but
from the Scripts directory of anaconda, not Python27 which you may have from your earlier Python installation. Yes, 
anaconda supports Python 3.x also. There is a mini-anaconda version useful for smaller footprint devices such as Raspberry
Pi. 

### I have included my versions of some early examples of the above cited book -- so you can see a few more commands.
